# My Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website - built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The website includes information about me, my skills, education, experience, projects, and a functional blog where I share my experiences.

## How to Use

To use my website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download and install a local server environment like XAMPP or MAMP.
3. Move the cloned repository into the 'htdocs' directory of your XAMPP or MAMP installation.
4. Start the Apache server through the XAMPP or MAMP interface.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to 'localhost/[your-folder-name]' to view my website.

## Structure

The website's homepage is `index.html`. From here you can navigate throughout all the pages using the navigation bar at the top.

## Languages/Markup
- I used HTML to create the main interface and functionality.
- I used `style.css` for the main styles (larger screen) and also adapts to smaller screen using media queries in the `mobile.css` file.
- I uses PHP for the server-side processing, such as validating the login using phpMyAdmin database, creating/viewing the blog posts
